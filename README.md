![FLUX Finetuning scripts](./assets/readme/dark/header-rev1.png)

This repository provides training scripts for [Flux model](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) by Black Forest Labs. <br/>
[XLabs AI](https://github.com/XLabs-AI) team is happy to publish fune-tuning Flux scripts, including:

- **LoRA** ðŸ”¥
- **ControlNet** ðŸ”¥

# Training

We trained LoRA and ControlNet models using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)! <br/>
Both of them are trained on 512x512 pictures, 1024x1024 is in progress.

### LoRA

```bash
accelerate launch train_scripts/train_flux_lora_deepspeed.py --config "train_configs/test_lora.yaml"
```

### ControlNet
```bash
accelerate launch train_scripts/train_flux_deepspeed_controlnet.py --config "train_configs/test_canny_controlnet.yaml"
```

## Dataset format
Folder with images and jsons. Each json have "caption" field. <br/>
Example: `["image1.jpg", "image1.json", "image2.jpg", "image2.json"]`

## Training Dataset

Dataset has the following format for the training process:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ 1.png
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ 1.json
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ 2.png
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ 2.json
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

### Example `images/*.json` file

A `.json` file contains "caption" field with a text prompt.

```json
{
    "caption": "A figure stands in a misty landscape, wearing a mask with antlers and dark, embellished attire, exuding mystery and otherworldlines"
}
```

## Models

We trained **Canny ControlNet** and **LoRA** checkpoints for [`FLUX.1 [dev]`](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) <br/>
You can download them on HuggingFace:

- [flux-controlnet-canny](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-controlnet-canny)
- [flux-RealismLora](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-RealismLora)

## Inference

To test our checkpoints, use commands presented below.

### LoRA

```bash
python3 demo_lora_inference.py \
    --checkpoint lora.safetensors \
    --prompt "A handsome girl in a suit covered with bold tattoos and holding a pistol. fantasy style, natural photo cinematic"
```

![Example Picture 0](./assets/readme/examples/picture-0-rev1.png)

### ControlNet (Canny)

```bash
python3 demo_controlnet_inference.py \
    --checkpoint controlnet.safetensors \
    --control_image "input_image.jpg" \
    --prompt "a bright blue bird in the garden, natural photo cinematic, MM full HD"
```

![Example Picture 1](./assets/readme/examples/picture-1-rev1.png)

```bash
python3 demo_controlnet_inference.py \
    --checkpoint controlnet.safetensors \
    --control_image "input_image.jpg" \
    --prompt "a dark evil mysterius house with ghosts, cinematic, MM full HD"
```

![Example Picture 2](./assets/readme/examples/picture-2-rev1.png)

```bash
python3 demo_controlnet_inference.py \
    --checkpoint controlnet.safetensors \
    --control_image "input_image.jpg" \
    --prompt "a handsome viking man with white hair, cinematic, MM full HD"
```

![Example Picture 3](./assets/readme/examples/picture-3-rev1.png)

```bash
python3 demo_controlnet_inference.py \
    --checkpoint controlnet.safetensors \
    --control_image "input_image.jpg" \
    --prompt "a oil painting woman sitting at chair and smiling, cinematic, MM full HD"
```

## Requirements

Install our dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

## Models Licence

Our models fall under the [FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/blob/main/model_licenses/LICENSE-FLUX1-dev) <br/> Our training and infer scripts under the Apache 2 License

## Near Updates

We are working on releasing new ControlNet weight models for Flux: **OpenPose**, **Depth** and more! <br/>
Stay tuned with [XLabs AI](https://github.com/XLabs-AI) to see **IP-Adapters** for Flux.
